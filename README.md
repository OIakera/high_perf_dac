#### High perf DAC | Magisk/KernelSU Module

#### - This Magisk/KernelSU module enables the "High Performance DAC" mode of Qualcomm's WCD9xx DAC to maximize it's power and get the best audio quality possible.

##### • `Every phone powered by a Qualcomm processor has a built-in WCD9xx Audio DAC, but it's rarely configured to be used to its full potential by OEMs. ... By enabling High-Performance Mode, the audio quality of Qualcomm-powered devices will not only receive a boost in volume but will sound more clear and crisp as well.`

##### • `Needs Kernel Support`

##### - INSTALLATION: Just flash via Magisk/KernelSU and reboot.
